    <h1>Mbappe at PSG</h1>
    <p> After winning Ligue 1 with AS Monaco, Mbappe made a statement move when he was only 18 for 180 million Euros! This was a world record fee for a teen at the time! He went on to make 308 appearances and scored 256 goals and provided 108 assists.</p>

    <h2>Mbappe's Dream Move</h2>
    <p>Mbappe as a child idolized Ronaldo(as many of us do) and his favorite club was Real Madrid so when the phone rang he picked up on the first ring. He made the move to Madrid for free during the summer of 2024, but received 150 million Euros as a signing on bonus! He took the #9 shirt and made the shift from Left Winger to Striker. Initially he had a poor start, but he improved with time and won the Pichichi(top scorer in LaLiga) and the Golden Boot(top scorer in Europe). Now it's his second season and he's gotten off to a strong start, already being the 2nd highest goalscorer across Europe's top 5 leagues, just behind Harry Kane for Bayern Munich.</p>
